  <h1> keyboard commissions </h1>
  <p> I'm opening custom keyboard commissions to people on the interwebs! Before, this was a service I only offered to my friends and family. I'm happy to do anything from just soldering some switches on, all the way to a complete build. I specialize in topre modification but have tons of experience doing MX style builds as well. If you are interested, feel free to send me an email at <strong> ankit [at] ucsc [dot] edu</strong>! </p>
  <p> Below are some photos of builds I have done in the past.</p>
